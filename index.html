    <h1>Hi! I'm Jaron, a second-year Computer Science major at Northeastern University.</h1>
    <p>I like to think about interesting problems and figure out solutions using my own intuition.</p>
    <p>Here is a 3D-renderer made from scratch in pure HTML+JavaScript:</p>
    <b>Controls: WASD for camera-level movement, QE for camera-vertical movement, and IJKL for panning.</b>
    <svg id="display" width="600" height="400"></svg>
    <p><b>Source code <a href="https://github.com/jaron-cui/jaron-cui.github.io">here</a></b></p>
    <p>Thanks for visiting.</p>

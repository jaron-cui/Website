                    <h2>Minecraft in Racket</h2>
                    <h3>September 2021 | Racket</h3>

                    <p>
                        Minecraft in Racket is a clone of the popular game <i>Minecraft</i>,
                        written in the Intermediate Student Language with Lambda (ISL) version
                        of Racket. The following are some of the features I've implemented:
                        <ul>
                            <li>3D graphics</li>
                            <li>Infinite, procedurally-generated terrain</li>
                            <li>Breakable and placeable blocks</li>
                            <li>Box-bounded collision and movement physics</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p>
                        I started this project because I thought it would be interesting to implement a very
                        object-oriented program in a functional programming language.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some of the notable differences between ISL and Java (the language that the
                        original game is implemented in) include ISL's lack of mutation, classes, and
                        static typing. On the other hand, ISL features first-class functions, which
                        Java lacks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These distinctions meant that I did not have access to convenient data
                        structures such as arrays, maps, and other constant-time access storage.
                        So, in the process of designing the project, I had to implement
                        immutable analogues. One example of this would be my replacement for Java's
                        HashMap: A tree structure bundled along with a comparison function, which
                        could on average retrieve key/value pairs in better than linear time.

                    <h2>Math Worksheet Generator</h2>
                    <h3>August 2021 | Python, LaTeX</h3>

                    <p>
                        Programmed in Python, this worksheet generator is flexible and extendable.
                        First, there are individual random problem generator functions, which
                        can be called to create a problem prompt and an answer.
                        Any number of these can be given to the worksheet generator, which itself
                        will randomly choose to use one of these generators for each problem.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am using LaTeX to handle formatting. Since I found the existing LaTeX
                        packages for Python to be unintuitive, I made my own classes for handling
                        LaTeX document creation. These classes have both generalized methods for
                        ubiquitous document elements which even people who are not familiar with
                        LaTeX can use, such as headers, page numbers, paragraphs, and alignment,
                        and the ability to include raw LaTeX script and packages.
                    </p>



                    <p>
                        For the worksheets I am currently using the program to build, I have made
                        multiplication and division problem generators for integers and decimals.
                        I can add more types of problems and remove certain types as needed, and
                        generate more worksheet PDFs without further modification.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Notably, my younger sister is not the most appreciative of the
                        extensibility of the program, likely since she is the one to whom I am
                        giving the worksheets.
                    </p>

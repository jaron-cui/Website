            <h2>Minecraft in Racket</h2>
            <h3>September 2021 | Racket</h3>
            
            <p>
                Minecraft in Racket is a clone of the popular game <i>Minecraft</i>,
                written in the Intermediate Student Language with Lambda (ISL) version
                of Racket. The following are some of the features I've implemented:
                <ul>
                    <li>3D graphics</li>
                    <li>Infinite, procedurally-generated terrain</li>
                    <li>Breakable and placeable blocks</li>
                    <li>Box-bounded collision and movement physics</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            
            <iframe width="768" height="432" src="https://youtube.com/embed/n3Io4oBeCn0?rel=0"></iframe>
            
            <p>
                I started this project because I thought it would be interesting to implement a very
                object-oriented program in a functional programming language.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of the notable differences between ISL and Java (the language that the
                original game is implemented in) include ISL's lack of mutation, classes, and
                static typing. On the other hand, ISL features first-class functions, which
                Java lacks.
            </p>
            <p>
                These distinctions meant that I did not have access to convenient data
                structures such as arrays, maps, and other constant-time access storage.
                So, in the process of designing the project, I had to implement
                immutable analogues. One example of this would be my replacement for Java's
                HashMap: A tree structure bundled along with a comparison function, which
                could on average retrieve key/value pairs in better than linear time.

            <h2>Math Worksheet Generator</h2>
            <h3>August 2021 | Python, LaTeX</h3>
            
            <p>
                Programmed in Python, this worksheet generator is flexible and extendable.
                First, there are individual random problem generator functions, which
                can be called to create a problem prompt and an answer.
                Any number of these can be given to the worksheet generator, which itself
                will randomly choose to use one of these generators for each problem.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am using LaTeX to handle formatting. Since I found the existing LaTeX
                packages for Python to be unintuitive, I made my own classes for handling
                LaTeX document creation. These classes have both generalized methods for
                ubiquitous document elements which even people who are not familiar with
                LaTeX can use, such as headers, page numbers, paragraphs, and alignment,
                and the ability to include raw LaTeX script and packages.
            </p>
            
            
            
            <p>
                For the worksheets I am currently using the program to build, I have made
                multiplication and division problem generators for integers and decimals.
                I can add more types of problems and remove certain types as needed, and
                generate more worksheet PDFs without further modification.
            </p>
            <p>
                My younger sister is not as impressed with the extensibility of the
                program, which may be related to being on the receiving end of its
                products.

            <h2>Photolithographic Mask Design Generator</h2>
            <h3>July 2021 | Python, KLayout</h3>
            
            <p>
                Over the summer of 2021, I joined a Binghamton University research project
                investigating a new type of nanoscale microphone. The project utilized the
                Cornell Nanoscale Facility in the prototyping and testing stage of the
                process, with the primary fabrication technologies including photolithography
                and material deposition.
            </p>
            <p>
                Photolithography involves selectively exposing a prepared wafer with
                ultraviolet light, where the sections shielded from the radiation are etched
                away by further processing and the sections exposed are protected.
                The light is sent through a pane of glass called a 'mask', which has been
                primed with opaque features to produce the shielded sections of the wafer.
            </p>
            
            
            
            <p>
                In order to create a photolithographic mask, we must first design a layout
                digitally. However, since physical tests on the resulting nanostructures
                need to be conducted on many slightly altered iterations of the same design,
                the team was manually adjusting the design, shifting vertices and dimensions.
                This was a tedious and time-consuming process, so I took the initiative to
                implement a program which could parameterize the design. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This program allowed for adjustments to be made to the primary dimensions,
                such as lengths or quantities of features. Then, all of the repeated
                sections and many minor dimensions would be automatically recalculated and
                be used to quickly generate a new design layout.
            </p>
            <p>
                My program output files in the GDSII (Graphic Design System) format, a
                file format commonly used for integrated circuit design. However, one of
                my team members is currently working to extend the program to output CAD
                files which can be used to simulate the physical design prior to real-world
                fabrication.

                    <h2>Minecraft in Racket</h2>
                    <h3>September 2021 | Racket</h3>

                    <p>
                        Minecraft in Racket is a clone of the popular game <i>Minecraft</i>,
                        written in the Intermediate Student Language with Lambda (ISL) version
                        of Racket. The following are some of the features I've implemented:
                        <ul>
                            <li>3D graphics</li>
                            <li>Infinite, procedurally-generated terrain</li>
                            <li>Breakable and placeable blocks</li>
                            <li>Box-bounded collision and movement physics</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p>
                        I started this project because I thought it would be interesting to implement a very
                        object-oriented program in a functional programming language.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some of the notable differences between ISL and Java (the language that the
                        original game is implemented in) include ISL's lack of mutation, classes, and
                        static typing. On the other hand, ISL features first-class functions, which
                        Java lacks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These distinctions meant that I did not have access to convenient data
                        structures such as arrays, maps, and other constant-time access storage.
                        So, in the process of designing the project, I had to implement
                        immutable analogues. One example of this would be my replacement for Java's
                        HashMap: A tree structure bundled along with a comparison function, which
                        could on average retrieve key/value pairs in better than linear time.
